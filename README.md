# CoinRally

### Introduction
Few games have developed on virtual reality as compared to 2-D games. We chose to develop a VR-based Car game named Coin Rally. You (player) have to collect coins on a track while collecting the coins obstacles (in the form of cars) will be there on the track and you have to dodge them. Your position on the leaderboard will be based on the coins collected. Moreover,  the collected coins can be used to unlock new cars. Usually, VR gadgets are costly. So, we are going to develop this game that can be played using VR cardboard which is far cheaper than VR gadgets.

### Features
The main functionality which needs to be implemented in the game is to enable the user to play 3D Car Driving game, where the user can get the excitement of Virtual Reality.

8. If the player’s car collides with the obstacles or the incoming cars, then the game will be concluded as over and spent time and collected coins will be calculated.

10.The player can choose different car and skin for the car by spending collected coins
